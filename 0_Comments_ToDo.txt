#### TODO #####
– Re-check imputed correlations 
– Complete "Run All" script
– Complete "Auxiliary" analyses

#### OPEN, DISCUSS WITH TOR & ULRIKE
Correct first drafts, decisions:
–We missed two major (PET) study:
1. T. D. Wager, D. J. Scott, J.-K. Zubieta, Placebo effects on human mu-opioid activity during pain., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 11056–61 (2007).
1. D. J. Scott, C. S. Stohler, C. M. Egnatuk, H. Wang, R. a Koeppe, J.-K. Zubieta, Placebo and nocebo effects are defined by opposite opioid and dopaminergic responses., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 65, 220–31 (2008).

–sorting of studies in tables (alphabetical?, year?,n?) and and forest plots (alphabetical?, year?,n?,weight?,effect?)

– ForrestPlot format:
	–sorting of studies


– Anthony Jone's and the last Remifentanil-Data are needed URGENTLY.
– Outlier handling
Publication decisions:
– What is the target journal?
	– Nature neuroscience
	– Neuron
	– Plos Biology
	– PNAS
	– Neuroimage
	– HBM
	– PAIN
Further Directions:
– Ask Tor for placebo-prediction mask(s). With the pipeline at hand, making Forest Plots for placebo-predictor would be a matter of minutes.
– Ask Tor/Ulrike whether we should ask collaborators if they agree to share data with one-another via OSF
– Re-Analysis price

#### ARCHIVED:####:
– For the Wager studies only rating differences are available. Since these were acquired within-subject, within-subject-correlations have to be imputed 
– Single data-points for placebo-control cannot be plotted for between-subject studies...
– NPS values (pain conditions only) for Freeman and Bingel'06 show really leptokurtic ("outlier prone") distributions (Kurtosis >7)... wrobel (>6), kong06 and choi (>5) also might be worth a look.
– The negative placebo-effect of the bingel-study is partly driven by an outlier...
– Discuss Choi et al.:
 	– NPS activation good (pain> no pain, control>placebo, also shows lower-NPS-during-placebo-anticipation trend)
 	– PROBLEM: Seemingly, separate GLMs were performed for each of the three experimental conditions for each session... brain images represent activation vs baseline+all other conditions. Comparable but a waste of power.
 	– PROBLEM: Evidence for artifacts (stripes, strong, large activation blobs near edge of brain)
 	– PROBLEM: Data for two sessions (300 images *TR=3= 15 min) per participant... the paper only mentions only first session of 15 mins... analyze second session? Pro: Higher Power, Con: Unpublished
 	– PROBLEM: (partly solved) Standardized images larger than brainmask (Functional2Standard used to normalize fsl images. Incomplete BET may lead to "residual scull" >> no problem then, alignment should be fine.)
– Discuss how to handle existing "baseline" data:
	–Pre-treatment baselines are available for: Bingel11, Kong06, Kong09
	–No-pain baselines are available for: Ellingsen, Rütgen, Zeidan
	–Special: Extra "treatment effect"basline is avaliable: Kessner
Solution a) YES: Analyze only Pain_Placebo vs Pain_Control. Pro: Easy to select, no computational problems, images/contrasts are comparable across all between and within-studies. Con: Discarding data means less power.
NO: Build contrasts against baselines where possible. Pro: More power for studies above. Con: Contrasts may not be comparable across all between and within-studies anymore. Contrasted NPS results often do not correlate positively within subjects anymore >> within-subject analysis may be invalid.
I would feel better not including the baseline data.
– Solve: Missing variables Bingel 2006:
	- gender
	- age
– Ask Elsenbruch for anticipation data (betas 1 and 5)
– Ask KONG: SPMs for NPS scaling for kong06, kong09, freeman
>> Especially the contrast in freeman et al. seems to be on a completely different scale than the simple-contrast images
– Solve: Missing variables Kong 2009:
	- Age
	- Placebo First. It is not mentioned in the paper whether skin-spots on meridian and non-meridian sides were tested in random order
	- Condition sequence: Placebo
	- stimInt: Stimulus Intensities currently missing
	– Anticipation data
