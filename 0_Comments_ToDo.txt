1.) Placebo-NPS paper first draft:
INCLUDE MAIN PAIN > BASELINE FOREST PLOT
Two step approach in informing the collaborators

a) Meta-stats for within-subject studies: Hedges'g RM, vs Hedges'g. Should we consult some expert? Whom Lakens, Senn, Borenstein?
b) Need placebo-prediction mask(s). With the pipeline at hand, making Forest Plots for placebo-predictor would be a matter of minutes.
c) What is the target journal?
Medical Journal/Translational Journal
	– NEJM
	– STM
	

	– Plos Biology
	– Neuroimage
	– HBM
	– PAIN
d) Did we miss two major PET studies? Beyond scope
		1. T. D. Wager, D. J. Scott, J.-K. Zubieta, Placebo effects on human mu-opioid activity during pain., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 11056–61 (2007).
		1. D. J. Scott, C. S. Stohler, C. M. Egnatuk, H. Wang, R. a Koeppe, J.-K. Zubieta, Placebo and nocebo effects are defined by opposite opioid and dopaminergic responses., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 65, 220–31 (2008).
e) "Full analysis" in paper, conservative/responder analysis in supplement
f) Which type of forrest plot:
	–  Sorting of studies in tables (alphabetical?, year?,n?) and and forest plots (alphabetical?, year?,n?,weight?,effect?)
	–  Labelling: Short: Studies + Year OR Long: Studies + Year + Conditions compared
	-  Data:
		A) Clean but uninformative version: Only mean ± CI
		B) Noisy but informative version: mean ± CI + ss data (problems: huge scale, diff WI/BTW-study designs, noisy...)
		C) Compromise: mean ± CI + ss data up to certain CI (problems: diff WI/BTW-study designs, how to treat outliers)
		>> Suggested solution: Clean for main manuscript, noisy for supplement.
2.) Validation paper 50%:
	Example of validation reliablity, cooperation

 	– Not a systematic meta-analysis. Different focus.
 	– How to deal with low-level stimulus activity of NPS
 	
 	– Nature neuroscience
	– PNAS
	– Plos Biology
	– Neuroimage
	– HBM
	– PAIN
	
3.) Misc:
	- Parental leave
	- Data-sharing agreement
	- Made a .git repo for analysis files separate
