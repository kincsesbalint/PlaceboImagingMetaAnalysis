Analysis decisions:
– Anthony Jone's and the last Remifentanil-Data are needed URGENTLY.
– For the Wager studies only rating differences are available. Since these were acquired within-subject, within-subject-correlations have to be imputed 
– Single data-points for placebo-control cannot be plotted for between-subject studies...
– NPS values (pain conditions only) for Freeman and Bingel'06 show really leptokurtic ("outlier prone") distributions (Kurtosis >7)... wrobel (>6), kong06 and choi (>5) also might be worth a look.
The negative placebo-effect of the bingel-study is partly driven by an outlier...

– Discuss Choi et al.:
 	– NPS activation good (pain> no pain, control>placebo, also shows lower-NPS-during-placebo-anticipation trend)
 	– PROBLEM: Seemingly, separate GLMs were performed for each of the three experimental conditions for each session... brain images represent activation vs baseline+all other conditions. Comparable but a waste of power.
 	– PROBLEM: Evidence for artifacts (stripes, strong, large activation blobs near edge of brain)
 	– PROBLEM: Data for two sessions (300 images *TR=3= 15 min) per participant... the paper only mentions only first session of 15 mins... analyze second session? Pro: Higher Power, Con: Unpublished
 	– PROBLEM: (partly solved) Standardized images larger than brainmask (Functional2Standard used to normalize fsl images. Incomplete BET may lead to "residual scull" >> no problem then, alignment should be fine.)
 
– Discuss how to handle existing "baseline" data:
	–Pre-treatment baselines are available for: Bingel11, Kong06, Kong09
	–No-pain baselines are available for: Ellingsen, Rütgen, Zeidan
	–Special: Extra "treatment effect"basline is avaliable: Kessner
Solution a) Analyze only Pain_Placebo vs Pain_Control. Pro: Easy to select, no computational problems, images/contrasts are comparable across all between and within-studies. Con: Discarding data means less power.
Solution b) Build contrasts against baselines where possible. Pro: More power for studies above. Con: Contrasts may not be comparable across all between and within-studies anymore. Contrasted NPS results often do not correlate positively within subjects anymore >> within-subject analysis may be invalid.
I would feel better not including the baseline data.

–Excluded Participants:
	bingel11_14:
	% For Subj14 of the Bingel Remifentanil study the one onset for the 4th pain stimulus was entered in
	% duplicate: the x-Vector is flawed.

– Discuss how to handle within-subject studies where only contrast placebo>control images are available...
in this case we cannot produce a standardized measure of effect/error without imputing (guessing) a within-subject correlating.
I would recommend using the mean correlation found in all other studies

Publication decisions:
– What is the target journal?
	– Nature neuroscience
	– Neuron
	– Plos Biology
	– PNAS
	
	– Neuroimage
	– HBM
	– PAIN

Further Directions:
– Ask Tor for placebo-prediction mask(s). With the pipeline at hand, making Forest Plots for placebo-predictor would be a matter of minutes.
– Ask Tor/Ulrike whether we should ask collaborators if they agree to share data with one-another via OSF
– Initiate symposium/meeting at a conference next year.






ANALYSIS:

##### CHECKS: ######

– Check for irregularities/errors in raw images:
	X Check for N of NaNs per study/condition
		– Kessner: One Participant with increased number of NaNs
		– Wager Princeton: Three Participants with increased (?) number of NaNs
		– Wrobel: One Participant with increased number of NaNs in haldol group
	X Check for mean signal per study/condition
	    – Choi: One Participant with decreased Mean Signal
	    – Bingel: One Participant with increased/decreased Mean Signal
		– Wager Princeton: Two Participants with increased (?) Mean Signal
		– Wrobel: One Participant with increased Mean Signal in haldol group
	X Check for IQR per study/condition
		– Huber: VEERY Tailed distribution of IQRs (2-5 Participants with with increased IQR)
		– Bingel: Two to three paticipants with increased IQR
		– Choi: One Participant with decreased IQR
		– Eippert: ~3 Participants with with increased IQR
		– Huber: VEERY Tailed distribution of IQRs (~5 Participants with with increased IQR)
		– Kong06: One Participant with with increased IQR
	    – Kong09: One Participant with with increased IQR
		– Wager Michigan: One Participants with increased IQR
		– Wrobel: One Participant with increased IQR in haldol group
  	    – Final Raw-data comparisons df vs raw data for every study and variable

ToDo Analysis:

NPS Meta-Analysis Anticipation: In studies with anticipation phase, placebo reduces (the already low) NPS activity...

SPM Analysis

##### RESULTS: ######
– Create tables + flowchart of screened/invited/included studies

Graph Descriptives: Mean age, Mean sex, Mean pain level

Graph Descriptives – Stacked bar graphs: Within/Between, Field Strength, Imaging type, Original Analysis software (SPM, fsl), Pain Stimulus type, Placebo Type


NOT DONE: NPS meta-analysis
– Look for meta-analysis tools
– Get tool from Cochrane, check calculation for two studies
– Get somebody with meta-analysis expertise to doublecheck


NOT DONE: Create SPM-maps for pain and placebo
	– SPM-analysis:
	LM:
	– Random Effect: Study
	>> First level
	– y= single-subject beta signal
	X
	– Factor: Placebo (Placebo vs Control)
	– Factor: Stimulus intensity?
	– Factor: Rating?
	– Factor: Rating difference?

	– Factor: Heat/Visceral/Electric/Laser stimulation
	– Voxel size/TR/TE

##### ToDo Collaborators: #####

– Collect Watson's, El-Deredy's and Anthony Johnson's data

– Solve: Missing variables Bingel 2006:

	- age

– Ask Elsenbruch for anticipation data (betas 1 and 5)
– Contact KONG: NPS scaling for kong06, kong09, freeman
>> Especially the contrast in freeman et al. seems to be on a completely different scale than the simple-contrast images

###### ToDo PROTOCOL update #######
	– Include analysis anticipation periods
	– Include NPS validation
	– Include inclusion procedures for re-analysed data-sets (chosen a-priori together with authors)
	– Include averaging procedures for data-sets where pain regressor was was modeled with a parametric modulator (e.g. to regress out time, stimulus intensity or ratings)
