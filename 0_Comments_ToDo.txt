#### TODO #####

#### DISCUSS WITH TOR & ULRIKE

1.) Meta-stats: Hedges'g RM, vs Hedges'g
Should we consult some expert? Whom Lakens, Senn, Borenstein?

1.) Need placebo-prediction mask(s). With the pipeline at hand, making Forest Plots for placebo-predictor would be a matter of minutes.

2.) Data-sharing agreement between collaborators.

3.) Did we miss two major PET studies?
1. T. D. Wager, D. J. Scott, J.-K. Zubieta, Placebo effects on human mu-opioid activity during pain., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 11056–61 (2007).
1. D. J. Scott, C. S. Stohler, C. M. Egnatuk, H. Wang, R. a Koeppe, J.-K. Zubieta, Placebo and nocebo effects are defined by opposite opioid and dopaminergic responses., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 65, 220–31 (2008).

Validation paper:
– What is the target journal?
	– Nature neuroscience
	– Neuron
	– Plos Biology
	– PNAS
	– Neuroimage
	– HBM
	– PAIN
	
Placebo paper:
5.) 
– "Full analysis" in paper, conservative/responder analysis in supplement
– Which type of forrest plot:
	–  Sorting of studies in tables (alphabetical?, year?,n?) and and forest plots (alphabetical?, year?,n?,weight?,effect?)
	–  Labelling: Short: Studies + Year OR Long: Studies + Year + Conditions compared
	-  Data:
		A) Clean but uninformative version: Only mean ± CI
		B) Noisy but informative version: mean ± CI + ss data (problems: huge scale, diff WI/BTW-study designs, noisy...)
		C) Compromise: mean ± CI + ss data up to certain CI (problems: diff WI/BTW-study designs, how to treat outliers)
		>> Suggested solution: Clean for main manuscript, noisy for supplement.
